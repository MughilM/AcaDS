    "This is the **second** notebook in a series of 3 that will work through predicting wildfire incidence using historical wildfire, climatology, and land usage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have already preprocessed our data from the 3 sources such that all datasets have the same resolution and size. For 10-minute resolution data, the shape is 153 by 351.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology Overview\n",
    "However, it is still not yet at point where we can simply pass the matrix through to the model. For each center cell, we must grab the values in all cells that are an L1 distance of $\\ell$ away from the center, where $1\\leq \\ell \\leq L$, where $L$ is the maximum distance we decide to look out.\n",
    "\n",
    "One sample will constitute of the input values **for each** $\\mathbf{\\ell}$\n",
    "* The percentage of cells at that distance that had a fire.\n",
    "* For each metric we choose to include, the average of the metric at that distance of $\\ell$.\n",
    "* For each land cover category, the percentage of cells at that distance that had that type of land.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, since we have both minimum and maximum temperature, we will only use the **average temperature** in order to avoid directly correlating variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our matrix, we can pass it directly through the logistic regression model. We will also allow for some minor scaling of values, and showcase the effects of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every resolution will generate a new input matrix and new target values. To minimize complexity, we will use the most coarse resolution of **10 minutes**. To run other resolutions, please adjust the variable in the notebook accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Packages\n",
    "As always, we will import all the packages we need. In addition to the usual data analytics, we use multiple capabilities from `sklearn` that will aid in preprocessing and building the model itself.\n"

    "One slight snag of the `ColumnTransformer` is that all the column names get wiped in the output. Worse still, they are also reordered such that all the transformed columns are at the beginning, with the unaffected columns at the end. In order to reorder these columns according to our original `X_train`, we need to do a little trickery. The exact feature name ordering can be had with `.get_feature_names_out()`. Then we find what index in the new ordering each column in the original is at, and then reorder it!"

    "Notice the **large** improvement we see in the F1-score for \"fire\" samples. Without scaling and class balancing, we saw only a pitiful 0.03 F1-score. After the preprocessing, it has jumped up to a respectable **0.69**! The downstream effect of this is that it also improved our accuracy by about 8%, up to 83%. What is additionally encouraging is that we didn't see a drop in performance for the \"No fire\" samples, and in fact, we saw a slight bump. This is the power of applying scaling transformations!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook, we saw how we can preprocess the data from before, and put it in a format to push through a logistic regression model. Additionally, we also applied normal scaling and power transformations to the metric columns, as well as removing any class imbalance, in order to vastly improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some future improvements could include applying additional transformations on the columns we didn't touch on. For example, for land cover, it could be possible to include a combined average, treating the land cover categories as actual integers. This can remove lots of columns from the input and reduce noise. Another thing you have noticed that is that the regression model was unable to converge, suggesting the data is not well-tuned enough for a logistic regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we will actually apply neural networks to see if we can squeeze even more additional performance out of our data."
